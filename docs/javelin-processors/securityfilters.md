# Filters

Security filters are a critical component of the Javelin platform, providing a robust mechanism for enforcing security policies and protecting sensitive data. These filters are designed to intercept, analyze incoming and outgoing data streams, ensuring that only authorized and secure information is exchanged between the platform and external systems.

## Security Filter Types

Javelin offers a range of security filters to address various security concerns and compliance requirements. These filters include:

### Garbage & Non-Ascii Character Detection

Identifies and flags garbage and non-ASCII characters from the input data, ensuring that only valid and sanitized data is processed.

### Language Detection

Detects the language of the input text, enabling language-specific processing and filtering.

### Code/Markdown Detection

Identifies code snippets and markdown content in the input data, allowing for specialized processing and validation.

### Malware Detection

Detects malware signatures and patterns in the input data, preventing malicious content from being processed.
