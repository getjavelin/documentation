# Hallucination Detection

Javelin can easily integrate with providers that detect hallucinations on existing routes and models. By enabling hallucination detection, Javelin can provide a probability score on LLM responses that application developers can use to inform their application logic. 

For more information on how to enable hallucination detection, refer to the [Javelin Processors documentation](../javelin-processors/overview).
