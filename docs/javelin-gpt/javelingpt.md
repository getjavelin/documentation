# Javelin GPT 

Javelin GPT is designed to execute queries across a spectrum of models, providing you with their outputs for analysis. Here's a summary of what I can do:

1. **Catalog of Routes:** I can present a catalog of routes or endpoints available for querying. This includes a range of fields and topics you might be interested in exploring.

2. **Execute Queries Across Models:** I can run queries through various language models, delivering their outputs in their original form. This allows you to analyze the responses from different models side by side.

3. **Direct Engagement with Model Outputs:** I showcase the results from queries unaltered, including metrics like faithfulness, relevancy, and context precision when available. This transparency lets you interpret these diverse insights independently.

4. **Python Execution:** I can execute Python code in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment. This allows for data analysis, visualization, and any computation you might need assistance with.

5. **Image Generation:** I have the ability to generate images based on text descriptions you provide. This can be used to visualize concepts, ideas, or scenarios.

6. **API Interaction:** I can interact with external API endpoints to fetch or send data, enabling a broader range of functionalities and access to real-time information.

The goal is to facilitate direct engagement with various model outputs, empowering you to discern and interpret insights independently, supported by my browsing, Python, and image generation skills.
