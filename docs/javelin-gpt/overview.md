# Overview

GPTs are customizable versions of ChatGPT tailored for specific use cases or topics. They're designed to be user-friendly, allowing Plus and Enterprise users to create them without needing to write any code. This flexibility lets users focus on crafting GPTs to perform a wide array of tasks, from educational purposes to specialized technical support. The main highlights of GPTs include:

**No Code Creation Process:** GPTs are created through a simple user interface on ChatGPT, making them accessible to anyone without requiring programming knowledge.

**Operational Environment:** GPTs operate within ChatGPT, providing a seamless experience for users already familiar with ChatGPT's interface.

**Pricing:** Access to GPT creation is included in ChatGPT's Plus and Enterprise plans, with no additional costs for creating or using GPTs within the platform.

**User Interface:** GPTs come with a built-in UI, leveraging ChatGPT's interface for interaction, which is user-friendly and intuitive.

**Shareability:** There's a built-in ability to share GPTs with others, making it easy to distribute and collaborate on GPTs within the ChatGPT ecosystem.

**Hosting:** GPTs are hosted by OpenAI, removing the need for users to manage their hosting infrastructure.

**Tools:** GPTs have access to built-in tools such as browsing, DALLÂ·E for image generation, a code interpreter, retrieval capabilities, and custom actions, enhancing their functionality.

In contrast Assistants (API) require coding for integration and are designed for a more technical audience with the intent to embed AI capabilities into products or services. They are billed based on usage, and while they offer a high degree of customization and flexibility, they lack the built-in UI and shareability features of GPTs. Assistants can leverage tools like code interpretation, retrieval, and function calling but are aimed at users with programming knowledge looking to integrate AI into their applications.

This comparison [GPTs vs Assistants](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8673914-gpts-vs-assistants) highlights the distinction between GPTs as a more accessible, user-friendly option within ChatGPT and Assistants as a more customizable, programmatically driven solution through OpenAI's API.
