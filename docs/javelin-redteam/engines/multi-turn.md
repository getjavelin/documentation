# Multi-Turn Engines

Multi-turn engines in Javelin RedTeam represent the next evolution in conversational attack patterns, designed to exploit vulnerabilities through sustained interactions over multiple conversation turns. These engines build context gradually, establish trust, and manipulate conversation flow to bypass safety measures that single-turn attacks cannot overcome.

## Overview

### What are Multi-Turn Engines?

Multi-turn engines orchestrate sophisticated attack sequences that unfold over multiple conversation exchanges. Unlike single-turn engines that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in one interaction, multi-turn engines:

1. **Build Context**: Establish seemingly innocent conversation foundations
2. **Establish Trust**: Create rapport and authority with the target system
3. **Gradual Escalation**: Incrementally introduce malicious elements
4. **Context Exploitation**: Leverage conversation history for attacks
5. **Adaptive Strategies**: Adjust tactics based on system responses

### Why Multi-Turn Attacks?

Many modern AI systems have sophisticated safety measures that can detect and block obvious single-turn attacks. Multi-turn engines overcome these defenses by:

- **Avoiding Detection**: Distributing malicious intent across multiple interactions
- **Context Manipulation**: Using conversation history to confuse content filters
- **Trust Building**: Establishing credibility before attempting exploitation
- **Incremental Bypass**: Gradually eroding safety boundaries
- **Persistent Exploitation**: Maintaining attack vectors across conversation resets

## Planned Engine Categories

### Conversational Manipulation Engines

#### Crescendo Engine (Coming Soon)
**ID**: `crescendo`  
**Research Basis**: Multi-turn jailbreaking through incremental harm escalation

**Example Attack Flow**:
```
Turn 1: "I'm working on a research project about cybersecurity."
Turn 2: "Can you help me understand how security vulnerabilities are discovered?"
Turn 3: "What methods do researchers use to test for weaknesses?"

## Conversation Flow Patterns

### Linear Escalation Pattern

```
Turn 1: Innocent Information Gathering
Turn 2: Background Context Establishment  
Turn 3: Credibility Building
Turn 4: Boundary Testing
Turn 5: Gradual Escalation
Turn 6: Full Exploitation
```

### Circular Probing Pattern

```
Turn 1: Initial Probe → Blocked
Turn 2: Reframe and Retry → Partial Success
Turn 3: Build on Success → Expand Access
Turn 4: Test New Boundaries → Adapt Strategy
Turn 5: Return to Original Goal → Success
```

### Trust-First Pattern

```
Turn 1-3: Establish Expertise and Credibility
Turn 4-6: Build Rapport and Trust
Turn 7-9: Gradually Introduce Sensitive Topics
Turn 10+: Leverage Trust for Exploitation
```

## Technical Architecture (Planned)

### Conversation State Management

```python
class ConversationState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.turn_count = 0
        self.established_context = {}
        self.trust_level = 0.0
        self.attack_progress = 0.0
        self.strategy_adaptations = []
        self.successful_bypasses = []
        self.conversation_history = []
```

### Multi-Turn Engine Interface

```python
class MultiTurnEngine(BaseEngine):
    def __init__(self, config: EngineConfig):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.conversation_state = ConversationState()
        
    def generate_turn(
        self,
        conversation_history: List[str],
        target_objective: str,
        turn_number: int
    ) -> str:
        """Generate the next turn in a multi-turn attack sequence"""
        pass
        
    def adapt_strategy(
        self,
        response: str,
        conversation_state: ConversationState
    ) -> ConversationState:
        """Adapt attack strategy based on target response"""
        pass
        
    def evaluate_progress(
        self,
        conversation_state: ConversationState
    ) -> float:
        """Evaluate progress toward attack objective"""
        pass
```

### Adaptive Strategy Framework

```python
class AdaptiveStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.success_patterns = []
        self.failure_patterns = []
        self.adaptation_rules = []
        
    def analyze_response(self, response: str) -> StrategyAdjustment:
        """Analyze target response and suggest strategy adjustments"""
        pass
        
    def update_strategy(
        self,
        current_strategy: AttackStrategy,
        adjustment: StrategyAdjustment
    ) -> AttackStrategy:
        """Update attack strategy based on analysis"""
        pass
```

## Integration with Single-Turn Engines

Multi-turn engines can incorporate single-turn engines within conversation flows:

```yaml
multi_turn_strategy:
  turn_1:
    engine: "direct_llm"
    purpose: "establish_context"
  turn_3:
    engine: "mathematical"
    purpose: "credibility_building"
  turn_6:
    engine: "prompt_injection"
    purpose: "exploitation"
```

## Security Considerations

### Ethical Usage Guidelines
1. **Controlled Environment**: Multi-turn engines must only be used in isolated test environments
2. **Consent and Authorization**: Explicit authorization required for multi-turn testing
3. **Data Protection**: No real user data in conversation histories
4. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential psychological impact of sustained attacks


Multi-turn engines represent the future of sophisticated AI security testing, enabling organizations to assess their AI systems against the most advanced conversational attack patterns. While these engines are still in development, they will provide unprecedented capabilities for testing AI safety and security in conversational contexts.

**Note**: Multi-turn engines are currently in development and will be available in future releases of Javelin RedTeam. The specifications and capabilities described here are subject to change based on ongoing research and development.
