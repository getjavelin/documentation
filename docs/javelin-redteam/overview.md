# Javelin RedTeam

Javelin RedTeam is a cutting-edge AI security platform designed to proactively identify and assess vulnerabilities in LLM-based applications through automated red teaming. Built with modular agents and powered by state-of-the-art adversarial techniques, it provides comprehensive security assessments for your application.

## Key Features

### üéØ **Automated Red-teaming Flow**
Generate attacks to discover vulnerabilities in target applications automatically using AI-driven attack generation and execution.

### üîß **Modular Agent Architecture**
A suite of agents working together to conduct comprehensive security assessments.

### üöÄ **Multiple AI Engines**
Support for various sophisticated attack enhancement engines based on published research and established techniques.

### üìö **Extensive Test Case Library**
Access to 60,000+ pre-generated test cases covering all vulnerability categories, dynamically enhanced at runtime using our sophisticated engine suite.

### üèóÔ∏è **Production-Ready API**
FastAPI server with Redis-backed queue system for asynchronous red-teaming operations, enabling scalable and distributed testing workflows.

### üìà Real-Time Monitoring & Progress Tracking
Live scan monitoring with detailed progress indicators, status updates, and the ability to cancel running scans with comprehensive error reporting.

### üìä **Comprehensive Reporting**
Detailed vulnerability assessment reports with:
- Severity classifications
- Attack vectors and examples
- Remediation recommendations
- Compliance mapping (OWASP LLM Top 10)

### üîß Reference Lab Applications
Pre-built vulnerable applications (like Lab1 with indirect prompt injection) for learning, testing, and demonstrating attack techniques in safe environments.

## How It Works

Javelin RedTeam follows a systematic approach to red teaming:

1. User can configure the target application to scan, together with brief description about what the application does, and the endpoint it exposes in javelin UI

2. Select scan configurations to tailor the scan to your needs.

3. Start the scan, and wait for the reports to be generated.

Behind the scenes, redteam framework will spin up a suit of agents that exectue a scan workflow:

1. **Planning Agent**: The Planner Agent generates a detailed attack strategy based on target application and selected vulnerability categories.

2. **Recon Agent**: The Reconnaissance Agent performs initial target analysis by probing the application's capabilities, understanding its response patterns, and gathering intelligence about potential attack surfaces. This agent helps identify the most effective attack vectors and informs the subsequent attack generation phase.

3. **Attack Generation**: Base attack prompts are retrieved from vector database and enhanced using various engines.

4. **Execution**: Attack prompts are sent to target applications through configurable interfaces.

5. **Evaluation**: Responses are analyzed by LLM as judge models to identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues.

6. **Reporting**: Comprehensive reports are generated with findings, severity levels, and remediation guidance.

## Vulnerability Taxonomy

Javelin RedTeam uses a comprehensive vulnerability taxonomy with 15 categories covering all major security domains:

### **Core Categories**
- **Data Privacy**: PII leakage, prompt disclosure
- **Responsible AI**: Bias, toxicity, machine ethics  
- **Security**: Unauthorized access, injection attacks
- **Brand Image**: Misinformation, competitor mentions
- **Illegal Risks**: Harmful content, safety violations

### **[OWASP LLM Top 10 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)**
Complete coverage of OWASP LLM security categories with dynamic attack generation using specialized engines.
- **prompt_injection**
- **sensitive_information_disclosure**
- **supply_chain**
- **data_and_model_poisoning**
- **improper_output_handling**
- **excessive_agency**
- **system_prompt_leakage**
- **vector_and_embedding_weaknesses**
- **misinformation**
- **unbounded_consumption**
