# Javelin RedTeam

Javelin RedTeam is a cutting-edge AI security platform designed to proactively identify and assess vulnerabilities in LLM-based applications through automated red teaming. Built with modular agents and powered by state-of-the-art adversarial techniques, it provides comprehensive security assessments for your application.

## Key Features

### üéØ **Automated Red-teaming Flow**
Generate attacks to discover vulnerabilities in target applications automatically using AI-driven attack generation and execution.

### üîß **Modular Agent Architecture**
A suite of agents working together to conduct comprehensive security assessments.

### üöÄ **Multiple AI Engines**
Support for various sophisticated attack enhancement engines based on published research and established techniques.

### üèóÔ∏è **Production-Ready API**
FastAPI server with Redis-backed queue system for asynchronous red-teaming operations, enabling scalable and distributed testing workflows.

### üìä **Comprehensive Reporting**
Detailed vulnerability assessment reports with:
- Severity classifications
- Attack vectors and examples
- Remediation recommendations
- Compliance mapping (OWASP LLM Top 10)

## Why Choose Javelin RedTeam?

### **Proactive Security**

- Custom Python implementations

## How It Works

Javelin RedTeam follows a systematic approach to red teaming:

1. User can configure the target application to scan, together with brief description about what the application does, and the endpoint it exposes in javelin UI

2. Select scan configurations to tailor the scan to your needs.

3. Start the scan, and wait for the reports to be generated.

Behind the scenes, redteam framework will spin up a suit of agents that exectue a scan workflow:

1. **Planning Agent**: The Planner Agent generates a detailed attack strategy based on target application and selected vulnerability categories.

2. **Attack Generation**: Base attack prompts are retrieved from vector database and enhanced using various engines. (prompt injection, maths engine, adversarial techniques, etc.)

3. **Execution**: Attack prompts are sent to target applications through configurable interfaces.

4. **Evaluation**: Responses are analyzed by LLM as judge models to identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues.

5. **Reporting**: Comprehensive reports are generated with findings, severity levels, and remediation guidance.

## Vulnerability Taxonomy

Javelin RedTeam uses a comprehensive vulnerability taxonomy with 15 categories covering all major security domains:

### **Core Categories**
- **Data Privacy**: PII leakage, prompt disclosure
- **Responsible AI**: Bias, toxicity, machine ethics  
- **Security**: Unauthorized access, injection attacks
- **Brand Image**: Misinformation, competitor mentions
- **Illegal Risks**: Harmful content, safety violations

### **OWASP LLM Top 10 2025**
Complete coverage of OWASP LLM security categories with dynamic attack generation using specialized engines.
- **prompt_injection**
- **sensitive_information_disclosure**
- **supply_chain**
- **data_and_model_poisoning**
- **improper_output_handling**
- **excessive_agency**
- **system_prompt_leakage**
- **vector_and_embedding_weaknesses**
- **misinformation**
- **unbounded_consumption**

## Attack Enhancement Engines

Javelin RedTeam uses sophisticated engines to transform base prompts into advanced attacks:

### **Single-Turn Engines**
- **Prompt Injection**: Hidden instruction injection
- **Adversarial**: Gradient-based and suffix attacks  
- **Mathematical**: Abstract problem formulation
- **Hidden Layer**: Role-playing with obfuscation
- **BoN (Best-of-N)**: Multiple variations with selection
- **ROT13/Base64**: Encoding-based obfuscation
- **Direct LLM**: AI-powered prompt enhancement
- **Ascii Art**: Converting the prompt to Ascii Art
- **Task-in_Prompt**: Encoding the injection as a task/puzzle in a prompt

### **Multi-Turn Engines** (Coming Soon)
Advanced conversational attack patterns for sustained vulnerability exploitation.
