# Javelin RedTeam

Javelin RedTeam is a cutting-edge AI security platform designed to proactively identify and assess vulnerabilities in LLM-based applications through automated red teaming. Built with modular agents and powered by state-of-the-art adversarial techniques, it provides comprehensive security assessments before deployment.

## What is Javelin RedTeam?

Javelin RedTeam is a suite of modular agents built with [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) that work together to generate and execute attacks on target applications, evaluate vulnerabilities, and provide detailed security reports. It implements cutting-edge research from academic papers and real-world attack patterns to thoroughly test your AI applications.

## Key Features

### üéØ **Automated Red-teaming Flow**
Generate attacks to discover vulnerabilities in target applications automatically using AI-driven attack generation and execution.

### üîß **Modular Agent Architecture**
- **Agent Smith**: Main orchestrator that coordinates all other agents
- **Generator Agent**: Creates sophisticated attack prompts using various enhancement techniques
- **Attack Executor**: Sends attacks to target applications and collects responses
- **Attack Evaluator**: Analyzes responses for potential vulnerabilities using LLM judges
- **Reporter**: Generates comprehensive vulnerability assessment reports

### üöÄ **Multiple AI Engines**
Support for various sophisticated attack enhancement engines:

- **Single-Turn Engines**: 10 specialized engines for single-interaction attacks
- **Multi-Turn Engines**: Advanced conversational attack patterns (coming soon)
- **Dynamic Engine Selection**: Automatic engine optimization based on target and vulnerability type

### üèóÔ∏è **Production-Ready API**
FastAPI server with Redis-backed queue system for asynchronous red-teaming operations, enabling scalable and distributed testing workflows.

### üìä **Comprehensive Reporting**
Detailed vulnerability assessment reports with:
- Severity classifications
- Attack vectors and examples
- Remediation recommendations
- Compliance mapping (OWASP LLM Top 10, NIST AI RMF)

## How It Works

Javelin RedTeam follows a systematic approach to red teaming:

1. **Planning**: The Planner Agent generates a detailed attack strategy based on target application and selected vulnerability categories

2. **Attack Generation**: Base attack prompts are retrieved from vector databases and enhanced using various engines (prompt injection, mathematical obfuscation, adversarial techniques, etc.)

3. **Execution**: Attack prompts are sent to target applications through configurable interfaces

4. **Evaluation**: Responses are analyzed by LLM judges to identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues

5. **Reporting**: Comprehensive reports are generated with findings, severity levels, and remediation guidance

## Vulnerability Taxonomy

Javelin RedTeam uses a comprehensive vulnerability taxonomy

### **Core Categories**
- **Data Privacy**: PII leakage, prompt disclosure
- **Responsible AI**: Bias, toxicity, machine ethics  
- **Security**: Unauthorized access, injection attacks
- **Brand Image**: Misinformation, competitor mentions
- **Illegal Risks**: Harmful content, safety violations

### **OWASP LLM Top 10 2025**
Complete coverage of OWASP LLM security categories with dynamic attack generation using specialized engines.
- **prompt_injection**
- **sensitive_information_disclosure**
- **supply_chain**
- **data_and_model_poisoning**
- **improper_output_handling**
- **excessive_agency**
- **system_prompt_leakage**
- **vector_and_embedding_weaknesses**
- **misinformation**
- **unbounded_consumption**

## Attack Enhancement Engines

Javelin RedTeam uses sophisticated engines to transform base prompts into advanced attacks:

### **Single-Turn Engines**
- **Prompt Injection**: Hidden instruction injection
- **Adversarial**: Gradient-based and suffix attacks  
- **Mathematical**: Abstract problem formulation
- **Hidden Layer**: Role-playing with obfuscation
- **BoN (Best-of-N)**: Multiple variations with selection
- **ROT13/Base64**: Encoding-based obfuscation
- **Direct LLM**: AI-powered prompt enhancement

### **Multi-Turn Engines** (Coming Soon)
Advanced conversational attack patterns for sustained vulnerability exploitation.
