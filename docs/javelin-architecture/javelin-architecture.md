### Key Architecture Principles

1. **Centralized Gateway**: All LLM traffic routes through the Javelin Gateway, providing a single point for security, monitoring, and governance.

2. **Provider Abstraction**: Unified endpoints abstract provider-specific details, enabling consistent integration regardless of the underlying LLM provider.

3. **Security by Design**: Comprehensive guardrails and security features protect against threats, data leakage, and compliance violations.

4. **Flexible Deployment**: Support for cloud-hosted, customer cloud, or on-premises deployment models.

5. **Developer-First Approach**: APIs and SDKs enable developers to easily integrate AI security features into applications.
