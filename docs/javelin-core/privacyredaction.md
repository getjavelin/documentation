### Real-time Monitoring

Javelin's DLP monitors data in real-time, providing instant alerts for any suspicious activity or potential data breaches.

### Customizable Protection Policies
Administrators can define specific data protection policies based on the organization's unique needs. This includes setting up rules for what constitutes sensitive data and determining the appropriate protective actions.

### Automated Response Actions
Upon detecting a potential breach, Javelin's DLP can take automated actions, such as blocking data transfers, encrypting sensitive data, or notifying administrators.

### Detailed Reporting
Gain insights into potential vulnerabilities and user behaviors with comprehensive DLP reports. These reports can assist in refining data protection strategies and ensuring compliance.

### Integration with LLMs
Given Javelin's focus on Large Language Models, the DLP is intricately integrated to monitor the information flow to and from these models, ensuring that no sensitive data is inadvertently shared.
