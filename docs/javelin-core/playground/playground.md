# Prompt Playground

## Using Javelin's Prompt Playground
The Prompt Playground is designed to be a versatile and user-friendly environment for crafting, testing, and evaluating prompts across a range of LLMs. Select Gateway, Route that you want to test and start crafting prompts to observe the model's responses. 

While using the Prompt Playground, you can either use configured Javelin Virtual Keys or use the Authorization header with bearer token to authenticate with the model provider. 

## GPTs
Javelin also developed [OpenAI GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-7kq4uSfJ4-javelin) (**ChatPlus subscription is needed to access**) and [Microsoft Copilot GPT](https://copilot.microsoft.com?gptId=f9edf9b0a9ca40a99ebce0a83822756e) that may be used as alternative interfaces for crafting and testing prompts. Please contact: support@getjavelin.io if you would like to use this feature.

## Chatbot Arena
Consider using lmsys.org [chatbot arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/) for your queries. Many models are now pretty good and it let you see where they differ while contributing to the public ranking.

## Vercel 
Another option is to use Vercel AI SDK [prompt](https://sdk.vercel.ai/prompt) playground
