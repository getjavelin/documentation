# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Overview

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized way for AI models to securely interact with external tools, services, and data sources.  
Within Javelin, MCP acts as a **bridge between LLMs and external systems**, enabling richer AI capabilities while enforcing enterprise-grade security, policy compliance, and continuous vulnerability checks.  


## Key Benefits

### **1. Enhanced AI Capabilities**
- **Tool Integration** – Connect AI to APIs, databases, and enterprise services.  
- **Controlled Access** – Enable/disable specific tools per MCP server, ensuring only approved tools are usable
- **Application-Centric Usage** – All MCP interactions are tied to the Application that invoked them, keeping usage, logs, and policies scoped to the right context.

### **2. Enterprise Security**
- **Policy Enforcement** – Apply filters (e.g., prompt safety, DLP).  
- **Audit Trail** – Every request and tool invocation is logged.  
- **Rampart Scan** – Whenever you **enable/disable a tool** or open the **Tools tab**, Javelin automatically runs a **Rampart vulnerability scan** to detect security risks in that tool.  

### **3. Operational Efficiency**
- **Simple Management** – Easy setup of servers and tool configs.  
- **Monitoring & Analytics** – Usage tracking, vulnerability status, and performance insights.

### Core Components
1. **MCP Registry** – Central place to register and configure MCP servers.  
2. **Policy Engine** – Enforces prompt safety, DLP, and other filters.  
3. **Tool Definitions** – List of tools available per server.  
4. **Rampart Scan** – Continuous vulnerability assessment for registered tools.  
5. **Chronicles & Audit** – Request/response logs for compliance.  

### Data Flow
1. Request initiated by AI (e.g., call to an external tool).  
2. Javelin applies **policy filters**.  
3. Tool is selected from MCP registry.    
4. Request executed on MCP server.  
5. Response returned, filtered, and logged.  

## Supported MCP Features

### **Tool Management**
- **Registration** – Add new MCP servers.  
- **Configuration** – Define endpoints, tokens, and tool details.  
- **Tool Status & Vulnerabilities** – Enable/disable tools and review Rampart scan results.  

### **Security Policies**
- **Prompt Safety** – Defend against jailbreaks or injection attempts.  
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** – Prevent sensitive data leakage.  


## Use Cases

### **Enterprise Applications**
- Customer Support agents with database access.  
- Document and knowledge base analysis.  
- Automated reporting and analytics.  
- Workflow optimization via tool-based actions.  

### **Development & Testing**
- Secure API testing.  
- Automated code/documentation generation.  
- Debugging and vulnerability scanning with Rampart.  

### **Research & Analysis**
- Market research with real-time feeds.  
- Scientific data exploration.  
- Financial and healthcare AI integrations.
