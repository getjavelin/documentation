# Overview

Welcome to Javelin, the high-performance enterprise-grade LLM Gateway & Model Router designed for modern organizations.

## What is Javelin?

Javelin is a cutting-edge gateway crafted to make Large Language Models (LLMs) seamlessly accessible to enterprises. While LLMs are heralded for their unparalleled capabilities, their integration often raises concerns related to security, cost, and data management. Javelin, developed using Golang, provides an ultra-low latency solution that centralizes LLM interactions, ensuring robust security and compliance.

## Why Choose Javelin?

#### Unified Access with REST API

No more sifting through vendor-specific API documentation. Javelin offers a standardized REST API for all LLM tasks, granting data analysts and scientists the liberty to work across various LLMs using a consistent interface.

#### Centralized Control

With Javelin, manage LLM credentials centrally through configured Routes. These routes represent LLMs from diverse providers, streamlining credentials and configurations. Grant access selectively to different users, from data scientists to production applications, without compromising on security.

#### Fiscal Responsibility

Stay in control of your budgets with Javelin's cost guardrails. Set financial limits for different routes (representing departments or user groups) and be confident that you won't exceed your LLM expenditure.

#### Enhanced Security Measures

Javelin takes data security seriously:

- **Data Leak Protection**: Actively monitors and redacts sensitive information, ensuring no PII/PHI leaks.
- **Hallucination Detection**: Uses proprietary technology to detect and manage hallucinations in specific routes.

#### Comprehensive Audit Trail

Benefit from Javelin's built-in memory store that provides extensive logs and conversational memory analysis. This feature is crucial for security teams, data scientists, and those needing in-depth forensics, audits, or downstream custom model training.

#### Support for Various LLMs

Whether it's the renowned OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropicâ€™s Claude 100k model, Javelin's flexibility supports both closed and open-source LLMs. Developers can engage with their preferred models via REST, Python, or Javascript clients.
