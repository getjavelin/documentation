# Overview

Welcome to Javelin, a cutting-edge security platform meticulously designed with the latest security standards and advanced content filtering. 

## What is Javelin?
Javelin is your security shield, keeping your data safe by reducing leaks and defending against threats and vulnerabilities. It's purpose-built to assist enterprises in preventing data leaks, protecting sensitive information, and managing AI-related risks.

The Javelin Platform is centered around our lightning fast LLM Gateway & Model Router, tailored for modern organizations. This advanced gateway simplifies access to Large Language Models (LLMs) for enterprises. While LLMs offer exceptional capabilities, their integration often raises data security and AI risk concerns. 

## Why Choose Javelin?
