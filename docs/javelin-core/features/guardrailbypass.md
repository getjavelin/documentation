# Guardrail Failure Intelligence

## Overview - Automatic Detection of Broken or Misconfigured Guardrails

Javelin automatically tracks and surfaces **requests that fail due to Guardrail misconfigurations or enforcement errors**, helping security and platform teams proactively address policy blind spots.

## üö® What Triggers a Guardrail Failure?

Guardrail processing can fail due to several reasons:
- **Processor Misconfiguration**: Incorrect settings or missing parameters in the guardrail definition
- **Internal Processing Errors**: Unexpected runtime issues within the guardrail execution logic
- **Missing Dependencies**: Unlinked data sources, broken policy references, or unsupported model configurations
- **Endpoint Failure**: The system was unable to resolve or reach the upstream endpoint associated with a guardrail processor. This typically occurs when:
    - The configured processor points to an invalid or non-existent domain
    - The route or service backing the guardrail is not registered or unavailable
    - There‚Äôs a DNS resolution failure, network partition, or missing internal service dependency

These failures are **classified as `GUARDRAIL_CONFIGURATION`, `GUARDRAIL_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE` and etc.. errors** and are now:
- Logged in the trace metadata for full visibility
- Accessible from the **Threat Alerts ‚Üí Requests With Guardrail Failure** dashboard
- Useful for debugging misrouted or unresponsive services during guardrail evaluation

## üìò Guardrail Error Types & Classification

To help teams rapidly diagnose and resolve issues, all guardrail failures are now **classified using structured error codes** with associated user-friendly messages.  

Each failure is also tagged with a **metric key** to support detailed observability and alerting.

### üß∞ Configuration Errors

| Error Code                        | Description                                       | User Message                                 |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `GUARDRAIL_CONFIGURATION_INVALID`| Invalid or malformed configuration               | Guardrail configuration is invalid            |
| `GUARDRAIL_CONFIGURATION_MISSING`| Required configuration not provided              | Required guardrail configuration is missing   |
| `GUARDRAIL_CONFIGURATION_MISMATCH`| Conflicting configuration or incompatible setup  | Guardrail configuration mismatch detected     |

### üåê Endpoint Errors

| Error Code                         | Description                                                | User Message                                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `GUARDRAIL_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE`  | Endpoint cannot be reached due to DNS or network errors    | Guardrail service endpoint is not reachable  |
| `GUARDRAIL_ENDPOINT_INVALID`      | Misconfigured or malformed endpoint URL                    | Guardrail service endpoint is invalid        |
| `GUARDRAIL_ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND`    | Endpoint is undefined or unavailable                       | Guardrail service endpoint not found         |
| `GUARDRAIL_ENDPOINT_AUTH_FAILED`  | Invalid or missing auth credentials                        | Guardrail service authentication failed      |
| `GUARDRAIL_TIMEOUT_CONNECTION`    | Connection timed out or was aborted                        | Guardrail service connection timed out       |

### üîß Service-Level Failures

| Error Code                         | Description                                           | User Message                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `GUARDRAIL_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`   | Service temporarily unavailable or restarting         | Guardrail service is temporarily unavailable  |
| `GUARDRAIL_SERVICE_RATE_LIMITED`  | Guardrail backend is being throttled                 | Guardrail service rate limit exceeded         |
| `GUARDRAIL_SERVICE_INTERNAL_ERROR`| Unexpected internal server issue                     | Guardrail service encountered an internal error|

---

### üåÄ General Errors

| Error Code             | Description                    | User Message                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `GUARDRAIL_GENERAL`   | Unclassified but known error   | Guardrail service encountered an error    |
| `GUARDRAIL_UNKNOWN`   | Unknown or uncategorized error | Unknown guardrail error occurred          |

---

### üìä Metrics & Observability

Each error is emitted with a metric key (e.g., `guardrail_error_configuration_invalid`, `guardrail_error_endpoint_unreachable`, etc.), enabling teams to:
- Track the **frequency** and **category** of failures
- Set up **alerts** for high-error conditions
- View the alerts in the threat **dashboards** to visualize the application health

> This structured classification gives you a consistent way to debug, alert, and remediate guardrail issues in production environments.

## üß≠ Where to Find These Failures

You can now **view all Guardrail-related failures** in a centralized location:
- **Threat Alerts ‚Üí Requests With Guardrail Failure**

This enables your security teams to:
- Quickly **identify and triage** misconfigured guardrails
- Audit **gaps in policy enforcement**
- Take **corrective action** before these failures lead to inconsistent behavior or security loopholes

## üîç Trace-Level Insight for Each Failure

Guardrail failures are now also surfaced directly within the **Attributes section** on the **Traces / Threat Page**.  
You‚Äôll see detailed failure metadata, such as:
- The name of the failing guardrail processor
- The reason for failure (e.g., config issue, timeout, internal error)
- Timestamp and route context
- Policy or model references that caused the failure

Example:

```json
{
"guardrail_error": {
        "endpoint": "https://guard-language.local.javelin.live",
        "error_reason": "HTTP request failed: Post \"https://guard-language.local.javelin.live/v1/internal/guard-language-detect/predict\": dial tcp: lookup guard-language.local.javelin.live on 172.20.0.10:53: no such host",
        "error_type": "GUARDRAIL_CONFIGURATION",
        "failure": true,
        "processor": "lang_detector",
        "retry_attempts": 0,
        "timestamp": "2025-07-21T15:04:36Z",
        "user_message": "Guardrail service encountered an error"
    }
