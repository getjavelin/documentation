# Throttling

Throttling in Javelin controls the rate at which requests are processed to protect your AI infrastructure from overload and manage costs effectively. This feature helps you maintain stable performance by limiting concurrent requests and implementing queue management for high-traffic scenarios. You'll learn to configure throttling policies, set request limits, and balance system performance with resource utilization across your AI applications.
