# Archiving 

Javelin provides organizations with state-of-the-art archiving capabilities, catering to diverse requirements ranging from compliance to model optimization.
Note: Archiving incurs separate storage costs

## Use Cases

### Audit & Compliance
For organizations that need rigorous documentation, especially those in regulated industries, archiving is paramount. 

**Configurable Archiving:** Every prompt, LLM request, and response sent on a route can be configured for archiving, offering flexibility based on organizational needs.

**Timestamp Annotations:** Each archived item comes with a timestamp, ensuring clarity about when interactions occurred. This is vital for chronological tracking and regulatory audits.

**Search & Review:** Using an intuitive interface, archived records can be queried and reviewed, ensuring that audits are smooth and hassle-free.

### Model Fine Tuning
To stay at the forefront of AI capabilities, enterprises often need their LLMs to evolve based on real-world interactions.

**Conversational Archiving:** Enterprises can store all conversations or request/response pairs from specific routes, amassing valuable data.

**Metadata Tagging:** Each archived conversation can be tagged with metadata, such as effectiveness or accuracy scores. This granular data is a boon for model developers.

**Training Support:** Using the annotated accuracy scores, developers can optimize models, ensuring they become more precise and reliable over time.

### Hallucination Detection
Once enabled, Archives can be subsequently searched or tagged with hallucination probabilities. See Hallucination Detection for more details. 

## Archive Retention
Ensuring data is stored only as long as necessary is both cost-effective and often a regulatory mandate.

**Route-specific Retention:** The retention policies can be fine-tuned on a per-route basis, ensuring different routes have retention schedules aligned with their importance or regulatory requirements.

**Time-based Purging:** Older records, like those beyond a specified period (e.g., 180 days), can be set for automatic deletion, ensuring efficient use of storage and compliance with data minimization principles.

## Compliance Deletions
In an era where data privacy is a global concern, being compliant with regulations like GDPR and CCPA is non-negotiable.

**Tag & Delete:** Specific records within the archives can be tagged for deletion, ensuring individual data subject requests (like right to erasure) are honored.

**Regular Audits:** The system allows for periodic reviews to ensure that no unauthorized or old data remains in the archive, reinforcing trust with stakeholders and users.
